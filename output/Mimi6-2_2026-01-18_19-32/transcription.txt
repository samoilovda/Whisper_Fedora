uh youth you asked a good question about well why do i need this application if you can just use
 chat gpt for all that you need uh well yeah well just like i can ask that i can ask in chat gpt hey
 um ask uh ask me a question about the situation um and don't give me an answer just ask me a good
 question that will make me think about the situation there is an uh there is a very important point
 to have a good diagnosis well we are here in the field of uh clinical psychology to
 to tell and a diagnosis um a therapist has to look for a while like to see your style
 to feel it to well to compare some things well you came to me two months earlier and you're coming to me
 now you said things like this and now you're saying like this what's what's inside your style are you
 is your style um constant or you are just like you know being very emotional fluid or something like
 that uh you have to feel the perspective because to solve one question right now it's much easier to
 use chat gpt but since it's the game you're developing you could share with your friends
 well maybe not friends but with some other people what progress do you have you see it as a game so there
 is well some level up system when you are being self-conscious
 and that's what chat gpt don't give to you because uh you have a limited context even if you try to
 ask uh chat gpt a lot or deep seek a lot you will face the limit and honestly i faced it a lot when i
 did my not work but when i worked okay with uh mural engines that bothers me a lot that you have a limited
 context and here when using this application you have a context that is being saved into the database
 and if needed you can just scroll through the stuff you answered you can use it in well um with your
 therapist because going to therapist you can just show him history of messages uh history record
 history if you'd like to like uh this one what do you mean by limited context
 uh uh well to to have um well do i have to explain you what's the limited context what's the concept
 of limited context context or what limited context yeah what do you mean by that what's in which way
 uh you have a limited uh amount of tokens that could be used to to chat with uh chat gpt or deep seek
 or grok or grok or every other oh you mean that at some point you cannot send anything anymore and
 then you have to start a new conversation yes and then you cannot see the context that uh application
 can see the context and if you have and also another problem of uh 30pt is that it also forgets
 so even you can talk a lot but then at some point it forgets things
 and remember some things you know so that's not so uh yeah and here is you having your own database
 based on your own answers that's why it's important to uh have this you know um iterational
 generic questions they are helping to create a portrait of a person and to address to these questions if
 needed like i see this uh application like uh it can take some answers from the context if needed
 to provide more precise uh and to to provide more precise questions like you know analyzing what person
 feel uh giving this context to neural engine you don't have to fill it up every time it's already there
 you're you're just asking another question and this question is on top of everything you've ever said
 to this application so everything you said is being sent on your engine if you're okay with that being sent
 and the most important thing that you can uh nothing um there is nothing personal no one knows who you really are
 in telegram it's the perfect base for this application i can tell the only thing that connects this
 this application to your real personality is your uh telegram nickname and that's it you don't send to me
 anything at all about yourself only your thoughts and uh you know feelings vulnerabilities but i don't know
 anything about you like at all you can have your telegram account registered on another person on another
 person another person's phone you have every nickname you want and you are using this application in and it's all
 all about yourself i think it's wonderful and it's much easier to to start with for people who are being
 maybe paranoid maybe um you know feel vulnerable about someone will know this and use this data against my
 uh my person telegrams uh defense not defense but telegram's protection system of personal data is one of the
 best in the world because pavel durov is from russia he knows what it takes to have a personal space
 his goal was to create a messaging application that is 100 percent untrackable and i think well we can't check it
 but i think it's 100 true uh when um when when authorities came to pavel durov and tried to well to have some keys
 to see personal um personal texts to other people he told he told him he told them that well i cannot
 provide you anything because this application is made that way i just can't help you like i don't know if i made it
 uh if i made this uh sentence okay if you can understand me he constructed this application
 to be safe for you that's what people yeah so people with data breach problems they will uh
 be more willing to use your app instead of like uh what's that for example yeah okay
 yeah that's because you know when you're sending things via whatsapp who knows where it goes well
 everyone everyone knows it seems like everyone knows where it goes but with telegram well
 you don't even know where the where do things go and telegram uh being suppressed in a lot of
 countries like again in russia uh iran and uh some other countries because it provides you a real free of speech
 yeah something like that
 okay well thank you so much for explanation sorry i have to shower and go okay because i i need to eat can't
